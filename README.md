# Introduction

The KEEPs Platform aims to build an ecosystem platform for a new concept culture and art industry that  
encompasses the entire art industry such as music, film, and drama. KEEPs aims to provide a space where  
anyone in the world can participate in and run the culture and art industry by providing a platform that can  
be used in a variety of cultural and arts fields.  
KEEPs is a content art platform developed on the basis of Blockchain. We want to build the ecosystem  
by stably systematizing the entire culture and art industry based on Blockchain, rather than simply using  
Cryptocurrency. From the past, humans have used various forms of expression to express their inner  
feelings and convey various meanings. This is human instinct, and has existed with any age and society in  
which mankind survives. This act of expression has grown through the Mesopotamian civilization, leaving a  
cultural record after mankind painted on the walls of the caves of Lasco and Altamira. Since then, numerous  
works of culture and art have had a tremendous impact on human life and the life of society as a whole in  
the history of mankind and have become a part of our lives now.  
KEEPs aims to create a creative ecosystem in which culture and arts can be assimilated in our work  
inheritance to create our own culture, rather than having a distribution structure through a simple system  
or virtual currency
